/* Instructions for remove debugging (Artur Andrzejak, 4.01.2019):
Setup:
    10. Include the options for allowing remote debugging in JVM (lines A10, A20) in file 
        ...\DSL-workspace\DSL-eclipse-theia\xtext-dsl-extension\src\node\backend-extension.ts
    20. Rebuild the js/theia with "yarn" in the main project directory
    30. Start eclipse, and configure Run-> Debug Configuration -> Remote Java Application as follows (if not already there):
     - Config name: "LangServer with Theia (target is client)" (or similar)
     - Project: "io.typefox.xtext.langserver.example.ide"
     - Connection type: "Standard (Socket ***Listen***)" (Important: choose "... listen"
     - Port 8123 (same as in Line A20)
     - On Tab "Common", check (enable) for "Debug" on "Display on Favorites Menu" (then can start debug from toolbar)

Start:
    40. Start Eclipse debugger (via toolbar, right-click, "LangServer with Theia (target is client)"
     - In the debug perspective, you should see sth like "Waiting for vm to connect at port 8123..."
    50. Start theia application (e.g. via "start_theia.bat")
    60. Open browser, load http://127.0.0.1:3000/
    70. In a tab with "*.dsl" file, press ctrl+space => eclipse debugger should show the current breakpoint
